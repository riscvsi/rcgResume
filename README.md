## ðŸ›  Professional Engagements
Hereâ€™s a glimpse into my professional engagements.
## Intel
Currently working in [Intel Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/intel-corporation/mycompany/verification/) - as Design Engineer
* Battlemage / Lunar lake :

* Section-level Timing Signoff Lead / IP-level MV Signoff Lead.
   * Both projects were running back-to-back.
   * Developed a script to ensure proper placement and implementation of IP-level repeater planning.
<br></br>

* Panther Lake  :

<img align="left" width="200" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.I-We-81F9Rh3gS9btacbEgAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" />

With the past experience of Meteor Lake, it should have been an easy task, but it presented tough challenges to close.
Each SOC-facing block had voltage areas where the secondary power grid was so dense that it broke the tool.

First-time implementation of Power Mux was used for controlling power delivery.
<br></br>


* Meteor Lake  :
  
<img align="left" width="200" src="https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/_processed_/5/8/csm_MeteorLake1_cb856a8dc2.jpg" />

Intelâ€™s big.LITTLE architecture in client chips. MV lead for Graphics IP signoff.

Responsible for:
Floorplan (FP) signoff of the MV blocks.
MV planning, including control signals planning and port placement feedback.
A significant challenge was automating the generation of feedthrough XML for feedthrough ports.


* DG1 :

Intelâ€™s second attempt at re-entering the discrete graphics card market.
The project utilized Intelâ€™s 10nm technology, completed on time by a team of freshers and recent college graduates (RCGs).
The main challenge was that the average team experience was less than 2 years. Despite these overwhelming odds, the team delivered the project within the time and quality requirements.
This project was both humbling and uplifting for me as a lead, as the team exceeded managementâ€™s expectations.

## QUALCOMM
* CAD Methadologist Qualcomm:

<img align="left" width="200" src="https://mspoweruser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/qualcomm-snapdragon.jpg" />
Collaborate with fellow Methadologist.
Scripted a Low power based solution for bus routing reducing power consumption in the chip.
Interacting with design team to automate and fix the pain points and recognizing the PPA exploits.
<br></br>
<br></br>

## Broadcom
* Section level lead Network server chips:

<img align="left" width="200" src="https://www.satellitetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/XLP500-Series-300x273.png" />

* Broadcom XLP MIPS network processors.
* Was responsible for MESH topology interconnect implementation.

### My opensource projects

*   [timing-server](https://github.com/riscvsi/ptServer2.git) - Created using python; created a timing server that can get any timing reports for n different runs. Has its own CLI very similar to primetime server.
*   [Django Timing reports display](https://github.com/riscvsi/timingServer.git) - Created using python and django; publishing the timing reports as a HTML page.
*  [Doit automation](https://github.com/riscvsi/ChipSutra.git) - created using python and doit library; versatile tool for automation. used this for running many parallel execution, generate reports and ECO.
*  [Riscv core](https://github.com/riscvsi/riscvCoreSyntaCore1.git) - a simple code full chip riscv implementation along with steps to run them on innovus. this is for students to run their hands on simple IP's and understand the PnR concepts.
